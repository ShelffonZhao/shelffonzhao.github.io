> “Batch Normalization works!”


## What is Batch Normalization & How does it work?

The detail of this technique can be found in [8.7.1 Batch Normalization, Deep Learning](http://www.deeplearningbook.org/contents/optimization.html).

## Why does it works?

The detail is pretty much written in [this blog](http://mlexplained.com/2018/01/10/an-intuitive-explanation-of-why-batch-normalization-really-works-normalization-in-deep-learning-part-1/) by a CMU master student, and it is good!

## To be continue

More detail explanation will be written later!
